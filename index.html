        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Sift flour           and salt into a bowl. Add egg, mixing to         combine. Gradually beat in milk, mixing          to a smooth batter. Chill for an hour.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>
            Stir. The batter will thicken on                 standing. Add a little water of                  necessary to bring it back to the                original consistency.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Heat a               greased small frying pan. Pour in just enough batter to cover the base of the pan. Cook         until golden on underside. Release around         edges. Flip or turn and cook other side.         Stack pancakes as you cook.
            </p>
            
        <p><strong>Serving Suggestions:</strong> Bacon and maple Syrup is always a win, berries and yoghurt is great as well! Feel free to add coffee, or chocolate milk to the recipe to really spice it up!

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Mix <a href="https://www.willcookforsmiles.com/the-ultimate-dry-rub/">dry rub</a> ingredients. (This recipe for dry rub will cover a 2.7Kg lb brisket.)
</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Take brisket flat out of the package, lay it on a cutting board and pat it dry with a paper towel. 
</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Spread a generous amount of dry rub on top, flip the brisket over and spread a generous amount of dry rub over that side. Make sure there is a good amount of seasoning and rub it all over all the sides of the brisket. Massage the rub into every nook and cranny and make sure it’s nicely coated all over. 
    
</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wrap rubbed brisket in a couple of layers of foil, covering it tight. Place wrapped brisket in a pan or a dish just in case some juices leak out, so that it doesn’t leak all over the refrigerator.
    
</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Refrigerate the brisket overnight or up to 12 hours. Take the brisket out of the refrigerator an hour before cooking it, unwrap and let it get to room temperature. 
    
</p>

<h3>Baking</h3>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 150°C and place a rack inside the large roasting pan. Lay a couple of sheets of foil that are long enough to loosely cover the brisket, criss-cross, on top of the rack. (You can layer the bottom of the roasting pan with aluminum foil to catch whatever drippings might leak through.)
</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place the brisket, fat cap up, in the middle of aluminum foil prepared in the roasting pan. Bring the aluminum foil together and close it, covering the brisket loosely, leaving a little space between the brisket and the foil. 
</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> UPDATE: Place in the oven and bake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes per 450 grams, until the brisket reaches about 80°C. Use a meat thermometer to measure the thickest part of the brisket. (My 2 kg brisket takes about 5 1/2 hours but there are many factors that can affect exact time. Meat itself will take different time and brisket can also stall at a certain temperature in the oven much like a smoker. Use a leave-in meat thermometer to monitor the temperature of your brisket and that way you won't have to keep opening the oven .) 
</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Open the foil and place it back in the oven. Bake brisket for another 45 minutes to an hour.
