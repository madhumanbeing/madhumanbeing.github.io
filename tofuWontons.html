<div class="ingredientList"></div>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 1</div>
 <p>Be sure to completely thaw your wrappers and allow it to come to room temperature so they'll ne very pliable. This will make it easier to handle and work with the wrappers to make your worntons. 
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 2</div>
 <p>Freeze your block of extra firm tofu at least overnight. No need to press.
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 3</div>
 <p>Be sure to completely thaw your tofu. Afterwards, press the tofu. The tofu will release a lot of water!
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 4</div>
 <p>Finely chop the chives. Then crumble the tofu.
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 5</div>
 <p>Heat a large pan over medium heat. Once hot, add in the oil. Saute the chives and tofu for 3-4 minutes. Allow any excess liquid from the tofu to evaporate. Season the mixture with vegetarian oyster sauce/stir-fry sauce, five spice powder, and salt. Mix well.
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 6</div>
 <p>Add in the corn starch and the mix well. This will help absorb any excess moisture and help bind the mixture together.
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 7</div>
 <p>Turn off the heat and transfer the filling to a bowl and leave to cool before using.
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Creating the Wontons</div>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 1</div>
 <p>Prepare a small bowl with water. Carefully separate the wrappers. It’s best to work with the wrappers at room temperature so they’re pliable and won’t easily break.
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 2</div>
 <p>Place 1 wrapper on a flat surface or on your palm.
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 3</div>
 <p>Dip your finger in the bowl of water and trace the edges of the wrapper. Add 1/2 – 1 tbsp of the filling (note that the amount of filling will depend on the size of your wrapper and type of fold you’re doing).
    Press down the filling to pack it tightly. Fold the wrapper into half until you have a triangle.
    Carefully press down on the filling to remove any air pockets. Then seal the edges tight.
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 4</div>
 <p>Flip over the triangle. Carefully press down the centre of the triangle. Dab one bottom corner of the triangles with water. 
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 5</div>
 <p>Afterwards, bring both ends together. Press down both tips to seal well. Repeat this for the rest of the wrappers until you have all your wontons.
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 6</div>
 <p>While you work on each wonton, you can cover your made wontons with a towel to prevent them from drying out.
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 7</div>
 <p>IMPORTANT WONTON FOLDING TIP: Be sure to keep the sides/edges of the wrapper cleaning try not to get any of the filling on it. This way you'll be able to seal the wontons well. When filling gets on the edges of the wrapper, some of the oil will make it slippery and hard to seal the wrapper together.
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Cooking</div>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 1</div>
 <p>Heat a large pot with water. Add a pinch of salt. Leave to boil over medium high heat. Once the water is boiling, add in 8-10 wontons, or depending on the size of your pot.
 </p>
 <div class="secondaryTitles">Step 2</div>
 <p>Leave to boil for 2-3 minutes, moving around with a spoon to prevent the wontons from sticking to the bottom, until the wontons float and wrappers are translucent. Remove from the water and transfer to a large plate or bowl. Repeat this for the rest of the wontons.
